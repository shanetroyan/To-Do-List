Here are the directions to run this web application...

1) Create a web hosting environment (either local or cloud)  
2) Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP (check compatible versions in source code)
3) Replace the index.php file with the one downloaded from the project
4) Add the 3 CSS style sheets from the project-> "milligram.css", "googleapifont.css", and "formatting.css" to the CSS folder of the web hosting environment
5) Ensure that Apache, MySQL, and PHP are currently running on the web host environment
6) Login to PhpMyAdmin with the following configuration -> host: 'localhost', dbname: 'mydb', user: "root", password: "" 
 For the host: if it is not being hosted locally then enter your web hosting URL in place of localhost. 

Note: If there is an error in connecting, make sure the database: 'mydb' has already been created in MySQL.
This can be done by opening the MySQL Command Line Shell and entering the following:

"mysql -u root -p create mydb"

Password: leave blank

7) Initialize a new table in PHPmyAdmin called "todos" with the following MySQL Query-> "create table todos (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, priority INT, duedate DATE, viewdropdown INT, PRIMARY KEY (name));"
8) Navigate to the web hosted folder: e.g-> "http://localhost/your_custom_site_name/index.php". 

Again if it is not being hosted locally then enter your web hosting URL in place of localhost. 

Additionally, if the site is being run on another port other than 80, or 8080 (Default) then enter it after the hosted url --> (e.g localhost:4001)

9) The web application should now load in your web browser and allow you to add and remove tasks as well as set the priority, duedate. 
Also you should be able to change the view drop down.

Screenshots will be added soon, thanks.
